## Relationship between two variables

- **Linear relationship:** the rate of change between two variables is constant
  - A straight line can be drawn to best fit the data

- **Nonlinear relationship:** the rate of change is not constant
  - A curved line would provide a better fit
  
## Independent vs. Dependent Variables

- **Independent Variables:**
  - Belongs on the x-axis
  - Influences the other variable

- **Dependent Variables:**
  - This is the response variable
  - It "depends" on the independent variable

  - Direction of the relationship
  - Curvature
  - Strength of the relationship
  
## Measures of Association between two variables

### Sample covariance

-  Positive value of sample covariance implies a positive linear relationship
between x and y.
  - As one variable increases, the second variable also tends to increase. 
  - As one variable decreases, the second variable also tends to decrease.
  
-  Negative value of sample covariance implies a negative linear relationship
between x and y.
  - As one variable increases, the second variable also tends to decrease. 
  - As one variable decreases, the second variable also tends to increase
  
- A sample covariance close to zero indicates no linear relationship  

- Does not give info on strength of relationship

### Sample correlation coefficient

- The correlation coefficient is known as $r$. 
  - This has a range of $-1 \leq r \leq 1$
  
- A positive value of sample correlation implies a positive linear relationship 
between x and y.

- A negative value of sample correlation implies a positive negative relationship 
between x and y.

- A sample correlation close to zero indicates no linear relationship  

- The closer the correlation is to -1 or 1, the stronger the relationship is in
that direction

### The sample coefficient of, $R^2$

- This value is simply the correlation coefficient, $r$, squared. 

- This explains the amount of total variation in y explained by x. 

- The larger the value, the better, because we would like to explain as much of 
the variation as possible.
