# Some practice problems

## 1

According to a research institution, the average credit card debt among college
students in a certain year was \$275.00. Assume the population standard
deviation is \$25.00 and that a random sample of 49 hotels was selected.

### 1a. Calculate the standard error of the mean.

### 1b. What is the probability that the sample mean will be less than \$280?

### 1c. What is the probability that the sample mean will be greater than \$300?

### 1d. What is the probability that the sample mean will be between \$245 and \$305?

## 2

According to a study, college students spent 1.7 hours per day using Instagrame.
Assume the population standard deviation is 0.4 hours per day. A random sample
of 32 students were selected, and had a sample average of 1.9 hours of
electronic media use per day.

### 2a. 

Is there support for the claim of the study using the criteria that the sample
average of 2.1 hours falls within the symmetrical interval that includes 95% of
the sample means if the true population mean is 1.7 hours?

### 2b.

Identify the symmetrical interval that includes 95% of the sample means if the
true population mean is 1.7 hours of electronic media use per day.
