## 1. 

According to a research institution, the average credit card debt among college
students in a certain year was \$275.00. Assume the population standard
deviation is \$25.00 and that a random sample of 49 hotels was selected.

### 1a. Calculate the standard error of the mean.

$$\sigma_{\bar x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{25}{\sqrt{49}} = 3.57$$

### 1b. What is the probability that the sample mean will be less than \$262?

$P(\bar x < 262) = \frac{262 - 275}{3.57} = -3.64$

=NORM.S.DIST(-3.64, TRUE) = 0.00014

### 1c. What is the probability that the sample mean will be greater than \$280?

$$P(\bar x >280)=1 - P(\bar x < 280)$$

$$\frac{280 - 275}{3.57} = 1.4$$

$=1 - NORM.S.DIST(1.4, TRUE) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$

### 1d. What is the probability that the sample mean will be between \$268 and \$282? 

$$P(268 < \bar x < 282) = P(\bar x < 282) - P(\bar x < 268)$$

$$(\frac{282 - 275}{3.57}) = 1.96$$

$$(\frac{268 - 275}{3.57}) = -1.96$$

$=NORM.S.DIST(1.96, TRUE) - NORM.S.DIST(-1.96, TRUE)= 95$

```{r}
xbar = 268
mu = 275
sd = 25
n = 49
se = sd / sqrt(n)

(xbar - mu) / se

pnorm(1.96)- pnorm(-1.96)
```

## 2. 

According to a study, college students spent 1.7 hours per day using Instagram.
Assume the population standard deviation is 0.4 hours per day. A random sample
of 32 students were selected, and had a sample average of 2.1 hours of
electronic media use per day.

### 2a. 

Is there support for the claim of the study using the criteria that the sample
average of 1.9 hours falls within the symmetrical interval that includes 95% of
the sample means if the true population mean is 1.7 hours?


Calculate the standard error:

$$\sigma_{\bar x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = 0.4/\sqrt{32} = 0.07071068$$

Find the z-score:

$$P(X > 1.9) = 1 - P(X< 1.9)$$

$$z = \frac{1.9 - 1.7}{0.07071068} = 2.828$$

$$=1-NORM.S.DIST(2.828) = 0.0023$$

Therefore this indicates that the sample average of 1.9 hours falls outside the
95% symmetrical interval, contradicting the claim of the study.

### 2b.

Identify the symmetrical interval that includes 95% of the sample means if the
true population mean is 1.7 hours of Instagram use per day.

$$=NORM.S.INV(1-(1-0.95)/2) = 1.96$$

$$1.7 \pm 1.96(0.071) = [1.56, 1.84]$$
