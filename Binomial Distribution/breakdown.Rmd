The binomial distribution deals with *discrete* data, which means that the data
is countable. For example, this could be the number of heads that are observed
in a certain number of coin tosses, or how many times a one on a die is rolled. 
The binomial distribution assigns probabilities to these situations, using three
key aspects:

1. **n**: This designates the total number of trials that were in our experiment.
    + Ex: Let's continue with the coin flip example. Let's say we are flipping
    the coin $n=2$ times.

2. **x**: This designates the total number of successful events we have.
    + Ex: For our experiment, let's say a successful event is landing heads up.
    (A quick note, a success does not necessarily have to be a "good" or 
    desirable event.)

3. **p**: This is the probability of having a successful event. 
    + Ex: It is common knowledge that a fair coin has a $p=0.5$ chance of landing
    heads, which is the event we have deemed successful previously.

## A motivating example 

* What is the probability of getting zero heads in two coin flips? 
    - If we get 0 heads, that means we have TT 
    - The probability of getting two tails is $\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$.

* What about exactly one head? 
    - There are two siutations that can happen: 
        1. A head on our first flip and a tail on our second flip (HT)
        2. A tail on our first flip and a head on the second flip. (TH) 
    - P(One head) = P(X = 1) = P(HT) + P(TH) = 
    $(\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{2}$.

## Dice Rolling example

- Roll a fair dice five times, where rolling a three is a success. 
    - Rolling a three has a probability of $\frac16$.

- What is the probability of getting exactly two rolls of three?

- There are many orderings where two threes can happen.
    - 33111, 31311, 31131, 31113, 133111, ..., 66633
    - These are called **combinations**.
        - Combinations are written as $n \choose x$, or $n \text{C} x$, which is
        read as "n choose x."
        - Out of the n trials, how many different combinations are there when 
        there are x successful events?
        - $n \choose x$ is defined as the following:

$${n \choose x} = \frac{n!}{x! (n-x)!}$$

- The exclamation point means **factorial**, which is where a sequence of 
numbers  are multiplied sequentially from 1 to the specified number. So for 
example, $4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$.

- To find the number of combinations, calculate:

$${5 \choose 2} = \frac{5!}{2! (5-2)!} = \frac{5\times4\times3\times2\times1}{(2\times1)(3\times2\times1)} = \frac{5\times4}{2\times1} = 10$$

- If there are five rolls, and two of the rolls are threes, this means that our 
two successful events occurred with probability $\frac{1}{6}$, and that the 
three failure events happened with probability $\frac{5}{6}$. So we are left with 

$$\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{5}{6} = (\frac{1}{6})^2(\frac{5}{6})^3$$

- the fractions don't take into account the combinations, so we add that 
information in to get the following.

$$P(\text{Rolling two 3s out of 5 rolls}) \rightarrow P(X=2) = {5 \choose 2}(\frac{1}{6})^2(\frac{5}{6})^3 = 0.193$$
