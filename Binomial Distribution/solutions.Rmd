# Some practice problems

## 1. Nancy has a coin that has a 75% of showing heads when it is flipped. What is the chance she is going to flip the coin heads 5 times out of 6 tosses? Assume each toss is independent.

### 1a. Identify x, n, and p
* x = 5
* n = 6
* p = 0.75

### 1b. Figure out the equality
This problem is calculating the exact probability of getting 5 coin tosses, so 
we are trying to find $P(X=5)$.

### 1c. Solve by-hand

$${6 \choose 5}(0.75)^5(0.25)^1$$

### 1d. Solve using an excel formula

binom.dist(5, 6, 0.75, FALSE)

## 2. A car insurance company has determined that 9% of all drivers were involved in a car accident last year. Among the 14 drivers living on one particular street, 3 were involved in a car accident last year. If the 14 drivers are randomly selected, what is the probability of getting at most 2 drivers who were involved in a car accident last year? Assume each accident is independent.

### 2a. Identify x, n, and p
* x = 3
* n = 14
* p = 0.09

### 2b. Figure out the equality

The problem states at most 2, which means that this will be all values from 0 up
to and including 2, so we are trying to solve $P(X \leq 2)$.

### 2c. Solve by-hand

$${14 \choose 0}(0.09)^0(0.91)^{14} + {14 \choose 1}(0.09)^1(0.91)^{13} + {14 \choose 2}(0.09)^2(0.91)^{12}$$

### 2d. Solve using an excel formula

There are a couple ways to solve this:

* binom.dist(0, 14, 0.09, FALSE) + binom.dist(1, 14, 0.09, FALSE) + binom.dist(2, 14, 0.09, FALSE)

* binom.dist(2, 14, 0.09, TRUE)

* binom.dist.range(14, 0.09, 0, 2)

## 3. A car salesman has 20 cars in his lot. He feels that there is a 40% chance of selling any one car during the week. Compute the probability of selling between 1 and 5 cars in one week, inclusive. Assume each sale is independent.

### 3a. Identify x, n, and p

* x = both 1 and 5
* n = 20
* p = 0.40

### 3b. Figure out the equality

This problem is a little bit different since we are trying to solve in a range 
that doesn't include the upper or lower end point of our range. Instead, we are
operating on the range [1,5], meaning our probability statement is $P(1 \leq X \leq5)$.
This can be rewritten by $P(1 \leq X \leq 5) = P(X \leq 5) - P(X = 0)$. The 
reason we subract the right portion is due to the fact that the left portion
already includes the probability for 0, so we just remove it. 

### 3c. Solve by-hand

$$\sum_{i=1}^5{20 \choose i}(0.4)^i(0.6)^{20 - i}$$

### 3d. Solve using an excel formula

* binom.dist(5, 20, 0.4, TRUE) - binom.dist(0, 20, 0.4, FALSE)

* binom.dist.range(20, 0.4, 1, 5)

## 4. A star basketball player shoots 25 shots during his game. His shooting accuracy  is 85%. Find the probability that he makes more than 15 of his shots in one  game. Assume each shot is independent.

### 4a. Identify x, n, and p

* x = 15
* n = 25
* p = 0.85

### 4b. Figure out the equality

More than 15 shots means we can use the complement rule to subtract the
probability of making at most makes 15 shots from 1, since "more than" implies
15 not being included in our calculation. We can rewrite this as 
$P(X > 15) =1 -P(X\leq 15)$

### 4c. Solve by-hand

$$1 - \sum_{i=1}^{15}{25 \choose i}(0.85)^i(0.15)^{25 - i}$$

### 4d. Solve using an excel formula

* 1 - binom.dist(15, 25, 0.85, TRUE)
