# Educational Statistical Shiny Applications for use in Introductory Statistics Courses

This repository contains shiny apps that were used to teach basic statistical concepts for the [STAT-S 301](https://stat.indiana.edu/undergraduates/courses.html) taught at Indiana University. Each app was designed to be used for half hour informal presentations during weekly lab sessions, which allowed students to receive further exposure to core concepts taught throughout the semester and further clarify points of confusion.

Each folder contains a simple breakdown of the concept, a few practice problems, and the Shiny application file.
