# Some practice problems

## 1 The average selling price of a television purchased by a random sample of 36 customers was $387. Let s be $32.

### 1a. Construct a 92%  confidence interval to estimate the average selling price in the population with this sample.

1. Since we do not know $\sigma$ (and s was given in the problem) we have to use
the t-distribution.
2. Calculate the critical values
    - The confidence level is 95%, making $\alpha = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$. 
    - Divide $\alpha$ by two, which gives us 0.04.
    - =T.INV.2T(1 - 0.04, 36 - 1) = 1.803
3. Calculate the standard error
    - $se = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{32}{\sqrt{36}} = 5.33$
4. Put it all together!
    - $[387 \pm 1.803(5.33)] = [377.39, 396.61]$

### 1b. What is the margin of error?

Remember, this is just the right side of the confidence interval, so the 
calculation is simply $1.96(5.33) = 10.45$
