# Some practice problems

## 1 The average selling price of a television purchased by a random sample of 36 customers was $387. Assume the population standard deviation was $32.

### 1a. Construct a 95%  confidence interval to estimate the average selling price in the population with this sample.

1. Since $n \geq 30$, we can use the CLT.
2. Calculate the critical values
    - The confidence level is 95%, making $\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. 
    - Divide $\alpha$ by two, which gives us 0.025.
    - =NORM.S.INV(1 - 0.025) = 1.96
3. Calculate the standard error
    - $se = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{32}{\sqrt{36}} = 5.33$
4. Put it all together!
    - $[387 \pm 1.96(5.33)] = [376.55, 397.45]$

### 1b. What is the margin of error?

Remember, this is just the right side of the confidence interval, so the 
calculation is simply $1.96(5.33) = 10.45$

## 2. An advertising agency created a new advertising campaign for one its clients, which produces computer software. After looking at consumer data, the ad agency claims the average age of the company's consumers is 22 years old. Suppose a random sample of 43 consumers was drawn, and their average age of the sample was found to be 23 years old. Assume the standard deviation for the age of the consumers to be 2.6 years. 

### 2a. Construct a 92%  confidence interval to estimate the average age of the consumer.

1. Since $n \geq 30$, we can use the CLT.
2. Calculate the critical values
    - The confidence level is 92%, making $\alpha = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$. 
    - Divide $\alpha$ by two, which gives us 0.04.
    - =NORM.S.INV(1 - 0.04) = 1.75
3. Calculate the standard error
    - $se = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{2.6}{\sqrt{43}} = 0.3973$
4. Put it all together!
    - $[23 \pm 1.75(0.397)] = [22.31, 23.69]$

### 2b. Does this support the companies claim?

Since the companies claim that average age of its consumers is 22, and since 22
is not in the interval we just calculated, this **does not** support the 
companies claim.

### 2c. What would we have to do if our sample size was less than 30?

Assume the population distribution is normal since the problem did not state 
that it was in fact normal.
