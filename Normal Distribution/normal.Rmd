# The Normal Distribution

* This probability distribution deals with continuous Data

## Characteristics of the Normal

* Has a defined mean and standard deviation
    + Mean
        + Can take any value $[-\infty, \infty]$
        + The mean occurs in the center and the distribution is symmetric about 
        the mean.
        + The mean, median, and mode are all the same value
    + Standard Deviation
        + Has to be $>0$
        + This is the "spread" of the distribution
        + A larger standard deviation results in a more spread out distribution,
        and a shorter peak.
        + A smaller standard deviation results in a more narrow distribution, 
        with a taller peak.

## Using the normal to find probability

* The area under the curve is related to the probability

* What is the difference between $P(X < x)$ and $P(X \leq x)$?
    + Since the data is continuous, there is technically no difference
    + How is this different than the binomial?

* How do we find $P(X = x)$? 
     + You can't actually calculate this since it is continuous.
         + Since the range is $[-\infty, \infty]$, how can you find the 
         probability of exactly one data point?

# The Standard Normal Distribution

* This is a Normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard devation of one.

* What is a z-score?
    + $z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$
        + This shows that the z-score is nothing more than the number of 
        standard deviations away from the mean.
    + What are the units of a z-score?
        + There are none, it's standardized.

# The Empirical Rule

* The empirical rule is a great approximation for figuring out the probabilities
within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean using the areas under the
curve. Those areas are 68%, 95%, and 99.7%.

# How do we use Excel

* What is the difference between =NORM.DIST() and =NORM.S.DIST()?
    + =NORM.DIST() takes the arguments x, mean, standard deviation, and cumulative.
    + =NORM.S.DIST() takes only the z-score and cumulative. The s stands for
    the standard in standard normal.
