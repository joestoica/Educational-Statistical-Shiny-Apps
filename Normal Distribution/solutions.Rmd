# Some practice problems

## 1. Each month, a company averages 11,000 sales. Suppose the sales each month follows the normal probability distribution with a standard deviation of 1,000 sales per month. 

### 1a. What is the interval around the mean that contains 95% of the attendance? 

Using the empirical rule, we know that an interval around the mean that contains
about 95% of the area is equivalent to two standard deviations away from the 
mean. So this is simply $[11000 - 2*1000, 11000+ 2*1000] = [9000, 13000]$

### 1b. What is the approximate probability of making less than 12,000 sales in one month?

Using the empirical rule, we know that 12,000 is one standard deviation above 
the mean. This means that we can either find the area to the left of 12000, or 
we can subtract the area to the right from 1. 

For the first part, we have $0.0015 + 0.0235 + 0.135 + 0.34 + 0.34 = 0.84$

Or, $1 - (0.135 + 0.0235 + 0.0015) = 0.84$

## 2. According to a marketing website, adults spend an average of 75 minutes per day on social media. Assume that minutes spent on social media follow the normal distribution and has a standard deviation of 4 minutes. 

### 2a. What is the probability that an adult is on social media for more than 82 minutes? Use both =NORM.DIST() and NORM.S.DIST().

Using =NORM.DIST(), we first need to figure out the sign of our calculation, and 
then we can just plug in the information.

Since it says more than, we have $P(X>82) = 1 - P(X<82)$. So in Excel, we would
use $=1-\text{NORM.DIST}(82, 75, 4, TRUE)$

For =NORM.S.DIST(), we would first need to calculate the z-score, and then plug
it in. $Z = \frac{82-75}{4} = 1.75$. Then, we would just use $=1-\text{NORM.S.DIST}(1.75, TRUE)$.

Typically, it's easier to use the unstandardized test so we can avoid calculating
the z-score, but it's important to know how to do both.

### 2b. What is the probability that an adult is on social media for between than 65 and 70 minutes? Use both =NORM.DIST() and NORM.S.DIST().

Here, we are trying to solve $P(65<X<70) = P(X<70) - P(X<65)$.

So using NORM.DIST(), we would have $=\text{NORM.DIST}(70, 75, 4, TRUE) - \text{NORM.DIST}(65, 75, 4, TRUE)$

Using NORM.S.DIST(), we first need to calculate the z-scores.
$Z = \frac{70-75}{4} = -0.25, Z = \frac{65-75}{4} = -2.5$. Next, plug them into
the excel formulas. $=\text{NORM.S.DIST}(-0.25, TRUE) - \text{NORM.S.DIST}(-2.5, TRUE)$

## 3. For a standard normal distribution, determine the probabilities.

### 3a. P(Z < -1.23)

This is much simpler, we can just use NORM.S.DIST here.

$ P(Z < -1.23) = \text{NORM.S.DIST}(-1.23, TRUE)$

### 3b. P(Z > 2.89)

$P(Z > 2.89) = 1 - P(Z < 2.89)= 1 - \text{NORM.S.DIST}(2.89, TRUE)$

### 3b. P(-0.19 < Z < 3.02)
$P(-0.19 < Z < 3.02)= P(Z < 3.02)- P(Z < -0.19) = \text{NORM.S.DIST}(3.02, TRUE) - \text{NORM.S.DIST}(-0.19, TRUE)$
